Welcome to my Power BI Dashboards Portfolio — a collection of projects that showcase my ability to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights. These dashboards demonstrate how I use Power BI to connect, clean, model, and visualize data that drives smarter decisions across Fintech, E-commerce, Healthcare, and Supply Chain industries.

Each project in this repository reflects a different business scenario and analytical goal. You’ll find dashboards that track financial transactions, monitor customer behavior, analyze healthcare outcomes, and optimize supply chain operations. Every visualization is built with attention to clarity, interactivity, and business relevance, ensuring that decision-makers can easily explore key metrics and uncover trends that matter.

My design process emphasizes both functionality and storytelling building dashboards that not only look good but communicate insights effectively. I make extensive use of DAX functions, data modeling techniques, and automated measures to ensure accuracy, speed, and scalability across datasets.

Through this portfolio, I aim to highlight how data visualization can turn numbers into narratives and analytics into action. Each dashboard is a representation of my approach to analytical design: structured, insightful, and user-centered.

Thank you for visiting my repository. I hope you find these projects both informative and inspiring.
